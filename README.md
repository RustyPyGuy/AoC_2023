# Advent of Code 2023!
Hello Everyone! This is my third year with Advent of code. I haven't done a load of programming over the past year, so we'll see how it goes! 

### Overall Repository Features and Goals
- launches from the command line and takes arguments for the day and an input file.  Calculates the two results.
- Using the Clap crate for command line processing.
- Plan to implement tests for the daily challenges with the provided test input and output as test validation.

### Day 0 (T minus 1)
- Got the Git repository set up and copied over useful stuff from 2022 for some input/output functions and command line processing.  Added nearly automatic unit tests with macro rules to write the body of the test functions.


### Day 1
This was a surprisingly challenging first day with lots of gotchas.  There's not much special to write about my code.  It's my normal use of Rust. I had to re-learn the find methods for string slices and just remember how to do text processing in Rust.  It slowed me down a bit, but there were some debugging hurdles for challenge two as well.
